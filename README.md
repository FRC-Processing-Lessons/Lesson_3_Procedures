# Lesson 3 - Introduction to Procedures and Objects

## Setup

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/FRC-Processing-Lessons/Lesson_3_Procedures.git`

Navigate to your repository folder, and open the following file in Processing:

`Lesson_3_Procedures.pde`

In case you can't find processing, make sure that after unarchiving the application, setup shortcuts for the executable file.

## Series Overview
This is the second of a series of lessons on programming in Java for the FIRST Robotics Competition.  It is designed for novice programmers, and can act as a precursor programming sequence to learning FRC-Java.  We will introduce:

1. Data abstraction
2. Procedure invocations   <--- We are here!
3. Procedure definitions   
4. Looped behavior
5. Field scope
6. Class definitions
7. Object instantiations
8. Instance methods
9. Static methods

This series will be taught using the Processing framework for easy visualization.

## Lesson Overview

Once the repository is cloned and the file is open in Processing, students should see ___ TODOs listed. Throughout the course of this lesson, students...

1. Will instantiate the Rectangle class
   - Should differentiate between variable initialization and object instantiation.
   - Should explain what an object is in Java.
   - Should research the Rectangle class to understand its functionality.
2. Will call methods belonging to an object to manipulate the object's behavior.
   - Should explain how a method belongs to each instance of an object.
   - Should call a method by invoking the method belonging to an instance of an object.
3. Will create their own moving Circle class.
